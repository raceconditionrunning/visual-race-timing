# Visual Race Timing

A human-in-the-loop system for timing runners' laps based on a video. Originally built for Race Condition Running's [Drumheller Marathon 2024](https://raceconditionrunning.com/drumheller-marathon-24) event. Code based substantially on Ultralytics and yolo_tracking codebases, from which we inherit the AGPL License.

* Runner tracking using YOLO for person detection and pose estimation
* Approximate line-crossing frame selection
* Runner re-identification
